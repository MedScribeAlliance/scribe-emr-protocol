Sometimes it goes down my left arm too.\n\nDoctor: What does the pain feel like? Is it sharp, dull, pressure-like?\n\nPatient: It's more like pressure. Like someone is sitting on my chest.\n\nDoctor: What makes it better or worse?\n\nPatient: Walking or climbing stairs makes it worse. When I rest, it goes away after a few minutes.\n\nDoctor: Any shortness of breath, sweating, or heart racing with the pain?\n\nPatient: No, none of that. Just the chest pressure.\n\nDoctor: Let me check your vitals and examine you...",
